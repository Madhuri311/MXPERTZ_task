                    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
                    <p>We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br>
                        makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for<br>
                        people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles.<br>
                         One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br>
                         National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact<br>
                         on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was<br>
                         born. Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon<br>
                         emissions from harming the environment. With one rental<br> 
                         company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to<br>
                         opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable<br>
                          all-electric cars instead.
